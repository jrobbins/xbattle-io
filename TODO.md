## Next steps

* Remove shoelace
* Implement a very simple client
  * Lobby dialog that prompts for nick
  * Game screen that renders state
  * setTimeout to request arena from server
  * Cursor and keystrokes
  * POST orders as they are entered

## Game logic

* Choose spawn location
* Compute scrore and leaderboard, track max score
* Remove troop layer when zero troops, not timeout
* How does a player lose?
 * zero troops

* Terrain generation
  * Or design a fixed map?

## Client

* Mouse input
* Touch input
* Prediction for higher frame rate



## Game variations to explore

* Flags (Home base)?
 * Each player has a flag that they must defend.
 * Flag cell has extra growth

* Upgrades?
 * Flow rate, climb rate, growth rate, lethality, defense
 * Max troops per cell, paratroopers, build hill, lower hill
 * Earn choice of upgrades when score reaches threshhold
